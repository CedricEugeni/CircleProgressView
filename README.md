`CircleProgressView` is an Infuse like circle progress view

`CircleProgressView` is inspired by the work of [FireCore](https://firecore.com/infuse).
This library is for now a tvOS Framework target but may become an iOS one too in the near future.
The primary goal of the library is to display a completion percentage using a circle.
